# Personal Finance (Net Worth Tracking) Spreadsheet

A simple to use community-driven advanced spreadsheet (Google Sheets/Excel) for personal finance management, net worth tracking, general money management, financial goals and FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early). _Grown from the knowledge and interests of various Reddit money-based sub-reddits._

_Designed for British Pounds in the UK (GBP£) - but I'm sure it could work for other currencies/countries too.
Make sure to check for new versions as they may include bug fixes, improvements and new features!_

## Why

After looking around online for something suitable to track personal finance, and seeing the people of Reddit using their own various spreadsheets ([r/FinancialIndependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialIndependence), [r/FireUK](https://www.reddit.com/r/FireUK), [r/PersonalFinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinance), [r/UKPersonalFinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/)) - So I decided to put this spreadsheet together... I'm a programmer not a financial advisor and wanted a better way to manage personal finances, but don't have the time or capital to put together a full web-app _just yet_.

## License / Cost

This spreadsheet is free to use for personal use _(at your own peril!)_, the more people use it and provide feedback the better we can make it. 

_Please do not sell or redistribute this spreadsheet/work or claim as your own etc. Refer people to this GitHub page so they can join in and help improve it too!_

I'll publish updates as I find the time - donations _(features/feedback/monetary)_ are welcome if you would like to support the project! :)
